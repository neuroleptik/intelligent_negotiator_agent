# intelligent_negotiator_agent
An agent able to deal with another, which has learnt by itself using reinforcement learning  
Here is my code about reinforcement learning agent.

# Agents  
Agents are simulated by SPADE library, which is the JADE implementation (java module) for python.

# XMPP server 
Agent communication is based on XMPP protocol. You will need to install an XMPP server on your computer.   
For this project, I used [openfire server](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/).
